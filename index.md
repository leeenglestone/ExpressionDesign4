## Note to Microsoft
If you do not wish for me to maintain a website such as this for a product that has been discontinued and is probably trademarked, i'd love to enter into a dialogue around re-instating Expression Design 4 in the download section on the Microsoft site. Or alternatively making it open source to promote continued improvement and adoption.

Thanks. 

PS. Big fan, love your work ðŸ’•
