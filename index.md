## What is Expression Design 4?
Expression Design 4 is a free vector based graphic drawing application. It is believed by many to have a great balance of features and usability compared to expensive or complicated & unwieldy alternatives.



## Why this site?
Microsoft have unfortunately discontinued Expression Design 4, this seems to have included making it no longer available for download on their site.

However there are a great many people that still **love, use and strongly recommend Expression Design 4**.

## Note to Microsoft
If you do not wish for me to maintain a website such as this for a product that has been discontinued and is probably trademarked, i'd love to enter into a dialogue around re-instating Expression Design 4 in the download section on the Microsoft site.
